CampScout is an online platform that enables users to review and assess campgrounds. To submit a review or create a new campground, users are required to have an account. This was developed as part of Colt Steele's web development course on Udemy.

The project utilizes technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. For authentication purposes, Passport.js has been integrated into the system.

## Features
* Users can create, read, edit, and remove campgrounds
